# Portfolio Site 

  This project is serving two purposes: sharpening my coding abilities and providing me an outlet during the Coronavirus quarantine. My intention was simple, to create a website to showcase my programming and hardware projects, as well as my personal writings. However, upon the realization that I wouldn't be satisfied with paying for a website design tool in light of being a programmer, I soon entered into a much larger project I didn't foresee.
  
  I began with learning HTML elements for a basic template for the site. I've had experience with Flask and its HTML inheritance ability served by Jinga got me started on making a layout template for all other pages to inherit. Once I got the site functional is when the real fun began. I wanted to customize the design of the pages, and this of course meant I had to learn CSS. Once I got a grip on how CSS worked, I implemented my first design which I'm currently using, as of March 27th, 2020. As of now, I'm diving deeper into CSS attributes and properties to enhance the site's design to my liking. This of course generated the necessity for more advanced HTML.
 
To be cont.
