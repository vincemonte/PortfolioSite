# Portfolio Site Changelog

## 3/27/20 Entry:

  This project is serving two purposes: sharpening my coding abilities and providing me an outlet during the Coronavirus quarantine. My intention was simple, to create a website to showcase my programming and hardware projects, as well as my personal writings. However, upon the realization that I wouldn't be satisfied with paying for a website design tool in light of being a programmer, I soon entered into a much larger project I didn't foresee.

  I began with learning HTML elements for a basic template for the site. I've had experience with Flask and its HTML inheritance ability served by Jinga got me started on making a layout template for all other pages to inherit. Once I got the site functional is when the real fun began. I wanted to customize the design of the pages, and this of course meant I had to learn CSS. Once I got a grip on how CSS worked, I implemented my first design which I'm currently using, as of March 27th, 2020. As of now, I'm diving deeper into CSS attributes and properties to enhance the site's design to my liking.

## 3/31/20 Entry:

  Since my last entry I've taken a break from coding the site as I had the vision to include a logo on the navigation bar. Having a personal logo has been something I've always wanted since I was a kid; something that represents my namesake, instantly marking my doings with a personal touch.  This was the next stage in the project: design a logo for my site that's scalable in size with no loss in quality. This is where I was recommended to use Adobe Illustrator; its objects are measured in vectors rather than pixels, allowing the image to be scaled to whatever dimensions desired, losslessly. However, like any new software, Illustrator proved to have a learning curve which I've spent the days since my last update learning. I went through my first rendition of the logo:

  I wasn't content with how linear it was and I rarely go with my first mock up. Where the fun really began is when I learned how to import scanned images into Illustrator. I drew my idea for the new logo in my sketchbook as can be seen here:

  From there, I scanned it and loaded it into Illustrator, made it the background of my art board, and turned the opacity down. I then used the Illustrator tools to draw over my sketch, ensuring perfect symmetry and centeredness. After that, I tweaked the original design a bit, added a background, played with the colors, and arrived at the final logo which I'm very proud to have finished. The result can be seen below.  The logo will serve as a mark for my website as well as being made into physical stickers for my personal use. All in all, learning Illustrator proved an entertaining and rich exercise, and I intend to further my abilities in it for other applications.

## 4/2/20 Entry:

  As I've played around with the CSS styling of the website, I realized that it lacked something I was looking for, a modern feel to the user experience and overall look. The CSS I was implementing was base at best, with most of what I was coding coming from a 2012 textbook. I consulted a friend who recently made his website, that of which I really enjoyed the look of. I asked him what he'd used to create something so modern with such little front-end experience. He told me to look into Bootstrap. As of yesterday, I have been learning the ins and outs of Bootstrap; it is vast and powerful. Updates to the repository will be delayed while I do most of the Bootstrap testing on separate HTML files. Check in soon.

## 4/3/20 Entry:
  I've been learning the Bootstrap framework by implementing their own [examples](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/examples/) as well as the incredibly helpful site, [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/). I've decided to work with their card components for my home page's media postings, as the cards serve this purpose well. I also discovered that using the built-in browser tool, "inspect", I can easily debug the CSS. I changed some of the page's formatting as well as began to use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to find a nice font for my text.
